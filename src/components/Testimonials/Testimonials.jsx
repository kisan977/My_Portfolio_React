              Not only was Kisanâ€™s work on-time and to spec, he pays attention
              to improve the aesthetics of the site as well as the
              functionality. Throughout the entire process he is responsive, and
              willing to work through issues as they arise.

              Working with kisan was better than expected and we had really high
              expectations. He is an incredibly talented developer but what
              really makes him stand out is his work ethic and steady approach.
